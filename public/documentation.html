    <h1>My Flix API - Movie information and User management</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p> The My Flix API is a RESTful web service that provides users access to a comprehensive database of movies,
      directors, and genres. This API was built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It enables users to explore movie
      details, manage their profiles, and curate a list of their favorite movies. The API supports CRUD operations,
      ensuring seamless interaction with movie-related data, user authentication, and profile management. It was
      designed as part of a full-stack MERN application. The My Flix API is the backend foundation for delivering a
      dynamic and engaging movie discovery experience.</p>
